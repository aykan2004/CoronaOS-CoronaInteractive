                                                    Inspiration

        Covid-19 has impacted many industries such as health, economy, education etc.
        We focused on the psychological and economical side. With our app for businesses, 
        you can implement things such as social distancing and required workspace rules in business management. 
        Our second app is to create a solution for online shopping with local suppliers during this pandemic. 
        Our second app also includes a feedback-based test to determine the psychological effects of staying at 
        home because of Covid-19. We decided to create 2 applications to tackle these issues, CoronaOS and CoronaInteractive.

                                                    What does it do?

                                                            CoronaOS

                      CoronaOS has two modes: one for employees and one for business owners. 
                      CoronaOS helps business owners to manage the workspace appropriately for Covid-19. 
                      Business owners must first enter the size of their workspace. Then the app shows how 
                      many people can work there at the same time. After the owner enters the professions in 
                      his business (janitor, cashier, security…) and the minimum number of employees from each 
                      profession for the business to function properly. Later, the owner enters the information 
                      of each employee (Name, Last name, Phone number, etc...) and an authentication key is sent to 
                      every employee via text. The app generates a work schedule for the business. The employee uses 
                      the authentication key to log in to the system to see his/her schedule for the upcoming days.

                                                           CoronaInteractive        

            In CoronaInteractive application you can do various things like online shopping, 
            taking quizzes to determine how your psychology is holding up, and watching informative videos about Covid-19. 
            The main star of this application is the quizzes. We prepared the quizzes with the help of a psychologist. 
            The quiz results will give feedback about your current psychological status and how you’re handling the situation.

            CoronaInteractive also has various informative videos about psychology that is in close relation to Covid-19. 
            We decided these videos were reliable and informative that is why we added them. 

            Our app also has a section where you can shop. Unlike the current online shopping sites, with our app, 
            each market will only serve to address within proximity. This way we can make sure local businesses still 
            receive an adequate amount of orders to prevent bankruptcy. To combat this, we decided to make sure everyone 
            can shop for things they need without having to go out while supporting local businesses. Our app also prevents 
            hoarding of essential items thanks to the max limit we have put on necessary items like (water and toilet paper). 
            In addition, customers will receive their orders in a shorter time and each product will be available at any given 
            time.
